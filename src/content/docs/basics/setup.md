title: Setup
---

## Node.js

We recommend using Node 18 or higher for running our projects. Astro recommends using Node `16.12.0` or higher. Other versions may work, but we do not test against them.

## Package Manager

We use `pnpm` to manage our dependencies. You can install `pnpm` using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Editor

We don't recommend any specific editor, but Astro recommends using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). **VS Code** has the best language support for Astro, and with a few extensions, the experience gets even better.
